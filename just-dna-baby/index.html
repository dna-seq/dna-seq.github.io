                    <h3>Thrombophilia risk </h3>
                    <p>Thrombophilia is a genetic condition that increases the risk of blood clots. Women with thrombophilia may have an increased risk of certain pregnancy complications, such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul><b>Miscarriage:</b> Blood clots in the placenta can impede the flow of blood and nutrients to the developing fetus, leading to miscarriage.</ul>   
                    <ul><b>Placental insufficiency:</b> Blood clots in the placenta can also cause placental insufficiency, where the placenta doesn't function properly, and the fetus doesn't receive enough oxygen and nutrients.</ul>
                    <ul><b>Preeclampsia:</b>  This is a serious pregnancy complication characterized by high blood pressure and protein in the urine. It can be caused by blood clots in the placenta.</ul>
                    <ul><b>Deep vein thrombosis (DVT):</b>  Blood clots in the deep veins of the legs are more common during pregnancy and can be life-threatening if they travel to the lungs.</ul>
                    <ul><b>Stillbirth: </b> Blood clots in the placenta can cause stillbirth, which is the death of the baby before birth.</ul>

                    <h3>Folate metabolism disturbance risks</h3>
                    <p> Folate metabolism is controlled by several genes. Just-DNA-Baby can provide important information regarding the genetics of folate metabolism. A disturbance in folate metabolism can lead to several pregnancy complications, such as:
                        </p>
                        <ul><b>Neural tube defects (NTDs):  </b> These are birth defects that affect the brain and the spinal cord. NTDs occur in the first month of pregnancy before many women even know they're pregnant. Adequate intake of folate before and during early pregnancy can help prevent NTDs.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Low birth weight:</b>  Folate deficiency during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight, which is associated with an increased risk of infant mortality and long-term health problems.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Anemia: </b>  Folate is essential for forming red blood cells, and folate deficiency can lead to anemia, characterized by a low number of red blood cells. This can make the mother feel weak and fatigued.</ul>

                    <h3>Risks of monogenic recessive diseases</h3>
                    <p>In the case of autosomal recessive inherited diseases, parents can be carriers of unfavorable gene variants but donâ€™t know about them. But if two unfavorable variants combine in a child, the disease will develop. An individual must inherit two copies of the mutated gene, one from each parent, to develop the autosomal-recessive disease. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent these diseases' complications. Just-DNA-Baby proposes to test and calculate the risk of such common diseases for the future child (based on parents' genome analysis):
                        We will provide assessment testing of these diseases risks:
                        </p>
                        <ul><b>Cystic Fibrosis:</b>  A genetic disorder that affects the lungs, pancreas, and other organs. It is caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Phenylketonuria (PKU):</b>  A genetic disorder that affects the ability to metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine. It is caused by a mutation in the PAH gene.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Hemochromatosis:  </b> A genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb and store too much iron. The disorder is caused by mutations in the HFE gene.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Galactosemia: </b> A rare genetic disorder that affects how the body processes the sugar galactose. Galactose is found in many foods, including milk and other dairy products. The disorder is caused by mutations in one of three genes: GALT, GALK1, or GALE.</ul>
                        <ul><b> Wilson disease:</b> A rare genetic disorder that affects how the body processes copper. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is responsible for the protein's function that helps transport copper out of the liver and into other body parts.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL): </b> is a type of hearing loss not associated with any other medical conditions or symptoms. It is caused by mutations in one of the many genes involved in the inner ear's development and function.</ul>

                    <h3>Sports abilities of a future child 
                    </h3>
                    <p>We think every parent-to-be wants to know in which sport their child can achieve the best results. The selection of a group of sports according to genetic testing helps to avoid many mistakes with the wrong choice of a sports section and disappointments for the child and parents. In addition, sports genetics provides an answer to the question - of how to avoid the health risks associated with sports.
                        Just-DNA-Baby will provide information regarding the listed sports abilities:
                        </p>
                        <ul><b>Endurance:  </b> Variations in certain genes, such as ACTN3, have been linked to differences in muscle fiber type and metabolism, which can affect an individual's ability to perform endurance activities such as running and cycling.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Power and strength: </b> Variations in genes that regulate muscle growth and development, such as myostatin, have been linked to differences in muscle mass and strength.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Speed:  </b> Variations in genes that affect muscle contractility, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene, have been linked to differences in running speed.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Agility and coordination:  </b> Variations in genes that affect nerve conduction and muscle control, such as the dopaminergic genes, have been linked to differences in coordination and agility.</ul>
                        <ul><b>Injury risk: </b> Variations in genes that affect the structure and function of joints and connective tissue, such as collagen and aggrecan, have been linked to differences in injury risk. APOE gene variants are related to increased brain traumatic injury.</ul>
                <p>Based on the scores obtained for these parameters, an assessment is made of the sports group in which the unborn child will be able to achieve the best results.</p>

                    <h3>Risks of diseases with hereditary predisposition
                    </h3>
                    <p>Many diseases have a hereditary predisposition, meaning that they tend to run in families and are caused by genetic factors.
                        They are not 100% determined by genetics. Both genetic predisposition and environmental influences contribute to the development of these diseases. The sooner we know about these risks, the more effectively we can prevent them.
                        Today, Just-DNA-Baby is the only platform that implements algorithms for calculating the risk of diseases with a hereditary predisposition in future children based on the analysis of the parents' genomes.
                        It will include the calculation of risks of future babies for the following diseases:
                         </p>
                         <ul><b>Type 2 diabetes:</b> a chronic condition that affects how the body processes blood sugar. It has a strong hereditary component, which tends to run in families. Studies have shown that people with a family history of diabetes are at an increased risk of developing the condition. However, genetics is not the only factor determining a person's risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Environmental factors such as diet, physical activity, and obesity also play a significant role so that we can modulate them.</ul>
                         <ul><b>Cardiovascular diseases: </b> a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It includes heart disease, stroke, and hypertension. It has a hereditary component but is also related to lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and obesity.</ul>
                         <ul><b>Cancer:  </b> many types of cancer have a hereditary component. Examples include breast, ovarian, colon, and prostate cancer.</ul>
