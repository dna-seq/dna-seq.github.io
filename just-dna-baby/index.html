            <p>Just-DNA-Baby is a service that helps parents understand the health risks and abilities of their future baby based on their own genetic information. By using the results of their own genome sequencing, parents can now get an idea of what their future child might be like in terms of health, sports, and smarts. Our goal is to give parents the inside scoop on their kids using the latest  cutting-edge scientific research. We provide probabilities for different traits like health risks, intellectual abilities, and overall well-being.</p>
